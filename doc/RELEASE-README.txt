This is a binary release of https://github.com/featherbread/yaml-split,
a silly tool that I use to test GitHub workflows, with the following contents:

  - yaml-split is the executable itself. It should require no additional setup
    to execute, as long as you've obtained the correct release for your
    platform. Try "./yaml-split --help" for a usage summary.

  - yaml-split.1 is the yaml-split manual page. Try "man ./yaml-split.1".

  - LICENSES.html provides copyright licenses and source code links for
    yaml-split and the third-party software it incorporates.
